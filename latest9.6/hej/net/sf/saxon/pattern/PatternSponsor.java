/**
 * The PatternSponsor class allows a Pattern to be treated like an expression. Although
 * patterns are not evaluated at run-time in the same way as expressions, they need to
 * be manipulated in much the same way as expressions at compile time: for example variables
 * need to be bound, dependencies need to be analyzed, and so on. This is especially true
 * of patterns appearing in the xsl:number and xsl:for-each-group instructions (less so for
 * the more common match patterns in xsl:template).
 * <p/>
 * <p>This class implements the Expression interface, so that an Expression can have a
 * PatternSponsor as a subexpression; it wraps a Pattern.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>A Pattern is treated as a boolean expression that returns true if the pattern matches
 * the context node. It is evaluated in that way only when obtained through the s9api
 * {@link net.sf.saxon.s9api.XPathCompiler#compilePattern(String)} method.</p>
